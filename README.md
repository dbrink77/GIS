# Welcome
This is my public portfolio for Advanced GIS at CMU ! This is where you can find all of the cool ongoing projects I am working on. I post my ongoing GIS maps and projects in this folder, so it represents my diverse levels of research.

# About me
Hello! My name is Dennis Brink, I am a second year masters student studying in the Heinz school of information systems and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently studying public policy, where I specialize in housing policy research. I have analyzed housing from a variety of different sub categories such as affordable housing, land recycing initiatives and blight mitigation intervention. My current research is assessing the impact vacant land has upon community health within disadvantaged communities. What I love most about studying at Carnegie Mellon, is that learn new tools in analyzing data to create innovative solutions to some of the biggest social challenges. Creating maps with GIS can be a very powerful way of analzying and assessing society facing challenges. GIS is a tool that brings new avenues of visually understanding and comprehending narratives data tell. Its wide range of statisical and layering capabilites, allow for advanced spatial anaylsis. Througn my work in this I hope to be able to enahance my GIS capabilites, to allow for the development and creation of solutions to housing policy. 

In my future career I hope I can hone the use of GIS to assess ongoing issues to housing policy. My curren career goals are to work within the affordable housing space, in either the policy or development intersection of housing development. Knowing how to use GIS, allows me to map various indicators of econimic and statistical relevance of programs and policies such as inclusionary zoning practices and mixed income development. I want to be at the forefront of creating sustainable and innovative solutions to land use, and affordable housing development. 

# What  I hope to learn:

Through this class I would love to learning the following:
1. Advanced techniques of spatial analysis.
The incorporation of statistics into maps allows for data to take on flexible and various forms of hypothesis and policy testing.  Advanced tools in spatial analysis will allow for endless possibilities of new ways to create visualizations and stronger research and policy analysis. Further knowing how  and when to use different types of analysis with various public data and governmental data sets, allows for me to create a wealth of informative and insightful maps, opening windows to housing solutions. 
2. Project Management: 
Project management skills are crtiical to ensure that I can ensure the creation of efficient and timely work. The better organized  a project the higher possible rate of success it can have. This course will allow for me to understand how to organize, plan and document my work in ways which will enhance my projects and potential ability to respond to rfps and government based projects.
