# Why Grounded?
Grounded is an organization which is at the forefront of recycling the use of vacant and abandoned property for community, economic, and environmental development within forgotten and vulnerable communities. Pittsburgh was once a city, with a booming steel industry; since industry left, the city has lost over 50 percent of its population, leading to the expansion of vacant properties and lots. These vacancies have an impact upon the health and economic well being of their surrounding areas. The work of grounded, empowers comunnity lead development to take enhance their lost equity and wealth via community investment. As such a map which allows for Grounded to lay the framework for identifiying the communities they work in and providing communities an ability to enegage in their ongoing programs.
