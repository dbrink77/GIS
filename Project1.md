# Why Grounded?
Grounded is an organization which is at the forefront of recycling the use of vacant and abandoned property for community, economic, and environmental development within forgotten and vulnerable communities. Pittsburgh was once a city, with a booming steel industry; since industry left, the city has lost over 50 percent of its population, leading to the expansion of vacant properties and lots. These vacancies have an impact upon the health and economic well being of their surrounding areas. The work of grounded, empowers comunnity lead development to take enhance their lost equity and wealth via community investment. As such a map which allows for Grounded to lay the framework for identifiying the communities they work in and providing communities an ability to enegage in their ongoing programs.

# Method and Scope of Work

In order to start this work, I first began by looking through the Grounded website. By looking through their website and knowing about the variety of work they do, it made complete sense for me to analyze the colors on the website. I found a photo on one of the main pages and then uploaded it to canva, which then gave a list of hex codes assoicatd with a color pallette for the website.  The color pallette and photo can be foud below. 

#Insert Photo

The color pallete had multiple greens, as well as a grey and light beige colors.
