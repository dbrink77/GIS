# Google Maps API- Consulting proposal for Grounded. 

In this assignmen
This is a set up for place for me to upload onogin class work. Narrative and data visualizations coming soon!


Testing, need this to work for my assignment



# Why Grounded?
Grounded is an organization which is at the forefront of recycling the use of vacant and abandoned property for community, economic, and environmental development within forgotten and vulnerable communities. Pittsburgh was once a city, with a booming steel industry; since industry left, the city has lost over 50 percent of its population, leading to the expansion of vacant properties and lots. These vacancies have an impact upon the health and economic well being of their surrounding areas. The work of grounded, empowers comunnity lead development to take enhance their lost equity and wealth via community investment. As such a map which allows for Grounded to lay the framework for identifiying the communities they work in and providing communities an ability to enegage in their ongoing programs.


# RFP response for Grounded

# Method and Scope of Work

In order to start this work, I first began by looking through the Grounded website. By looking through their website and knowing about the variety of work they do, it made complete sense for me to analyze the colors on the website. I found a photo on one of the main pages and then uploaded it to canva, which then gave a list of hex codes assoicatd with a color pallette for the website.  The color pallette and photo can be foud below. 

#Insert Photo

The color pallete had multiple greens, as well as a grey and light beige colors.

The best way for me to convert this color pallete into a map was to place a higher emphasis on the use of greens for polygon based features, and use the grey and lighter colors, for features such as roads, and labels of features and background layers. Since the colors were on both sides of the specturm, I had to caefuly balance the uses of each, when I was designing the map of Pittsburgh. 

I learned that my base layer was way to dark after using the color pallete above on my initial map designs The redoing of the map, required additioal time as well as the use of a different base layer. The first photo is vindiciative of my first map attemt and the second photo represts the adjustments and changes for my current design.

As one can see, the dark green color of the background beyond the polygon of Pittsburgh, made it diifcult to refocus the inner workings of the map, on the features that would be important to Grounded.  It also made it more diffiult to find the appropriate means of striking a balance between the features.

In my final photo, one can see that color palatee and backgroun layer chosen were lighter to allow for a better focus on the important features of the map such as green spaced areas and transportation near by. '

On a smaller level, I then needed to make features such as roads, highways, rivers and transportation lines colors which would not interfere or overwhelm the green bassed design.

From the smaller graph above, you can start to see how the map was intended to present the main area of focuses being on green spaces, as well as the areas immediately surroundg them.  This helps with the design, because it pulls viewers into educational opportunities using green spaces. Names and icons of attractions such as businesses,  and tourist attractions were removed from the map, so that the focus was drawn back to the green spaces and their associating areas. The small scale helps Grounded better unack the local space, allowing for an assessment of whether the bordering parks nieghborhoods can be prime space fo expanding  green space, or strategic community develoment. 


Smaller and simple changes on the close in shots, shows that focus has remained on the green spaces. From a local level, Grounded will be able to add in thier own project information and supplant links on to their map without them being lost in a sea of icons and non connecting features. 



A table with all of the features used with their appropriate color and instructions on how to find them can be found within the lookup table below.

# Concluding results and steps Grounded can take moving forward

In conclusion, the map in its simplicity allows for Grounded to deveop upon the map by adding its own points of interest, allowing for success expansion of their community develoment initiatives.
